## Project Information
This repository contains my implementation of the lane finding pipeline for the Udacity CarND Nanodegree (original Udacity project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1)). 

* [`p01_lane_finding.ipynb`](https://github.com/mchano/CarND-P01-Lane-Finding/blob/master/p01_lane_finding.ipynb) contains the Udacity starter code and my implementation of the lane detection pipeline using OpenCV.
* [`writeup.pdf`](https://github.com/mchano/CarND-P01-Lane-Finding/blob/master/writeup.pdf) contains a description of the pipeline and my reflections on the project.
